# Lab 02 - Elementary Programming II

## 1. Objective
The purpose of this lab is to familiarize students with:
1. Input and output statements in Java
2. Primitive data types, variables, constants, operators, and expressions
3. Java String and char

## 2. Lab Learning Outcomes (LLO)
By completing this lab, students should be able to:
1. Use the Scanner class to obtain input from the user (console)
2. Define and declare identifiers, variables, and constants
3. Define and use Java primitive data types (byte, short, int, long, float, double, and char)
4. Work with Java operators to write numeric expressions
5. Distinguish between syntax errors, runtime errors, and logic errors

## 3. Theory Review – Data types and input statements
Java provides the following arithmetic operators. Assume the initial values of the variables as `a = 0`, `x = 13`, and `y = 5`:

| Operator | Name        | Example      | Changed values after execution |
|----------|------------|------------|-------------------------------|
| +        | Addition   | a = x + y  | a changes to 18               |
| -        | Subtraction| a = x - y  | a changes to 8                |
| *        | Multiplication | a = x * y | a changes to 65             |
| /        | Division   | a = x / y  | a changes to 2 if a is int<br>a changes to 2.6 if a is double |
| %        | Modulus    | a = x % y  | a changes to 3                |
